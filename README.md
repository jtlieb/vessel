# Vessel: an e-reader that gets out of the way
Vessel is a (work-in-progress) EPUB reader designed to bring back the physicality of normal books. It addresses the three biggest flaws with existing e-book apps: 

## 1. I cannot physically touch the words 
If I run my finger across words as I read, a normal e-reader intercepts my attempts at connection and swipes to the next page. 

## 2. Annotating is not effortless 
To highlight words, I need to press, hold, and then drag to select a phrase to highlight. This can sometimes be in conflict with flipping pages, so I may errantly highlight words when I'm just trying to swipe, and vice versa.  And typing on a tablet is not the smoothest way to get my thoughts out. 

## 3. My thoughts stay in the book 
Our current AI moment means it is important to export your notes to whatever your central repository is where AI can help you out.  Currently, my e-reader is where my thoughts go to die, I normally can't get them out of the app I annotated in.
