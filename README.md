# Vessel: an e-reader that gets out of the way
Vessel is a (work-in-progress) EPUB reader designed to bring back the physicality of normal books. It recognizes that you are not here to ogle at it's animations, responsiveness, or whatever else -- you are just here to read your damn book.

Vessel addresses three big issues with current e-reading solutions:
```
1. Physically touching words is impossible
When running a finger across words a normal e-reader intercepts this attempt at physical connection, interpreting as a swipe to the next page. 

2. Annotating is not effortless 
To highlight words you must press, hold, and then drag to select a phrase to highlight. This can sometimes be in conflict with flipping pages, so there are many errant highlights. And typing on a tablet is not the smoothest way to get thoughts out. 

3. Thoughts stay in the books, never to escape 
Our current AI moment means it is important to export your notes to whatever your central repository is where AI can help you out.  Currently, the e-reader is where thoughts go to die. It's difficult to  get them out of where I left them.
